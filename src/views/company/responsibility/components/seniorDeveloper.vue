          essential. This is a developer position and not a management position; the candidate will
          be expected to code and deliver software daily.

          <p>
            DevOps solutions to manage the release, quality assurance and support of our systems.
          </p>
          <p>Work to quantify existing capacity and future capacity requirements</p>
          <p>Agile environment, working closely with users and developers from other teams</p>
          <p>
            Successful candidate will be part of the Agency Trading front-office technology group
            and have ample opportunity to learn business knowledge by interacting with business
            users (traders, starts, controllers, risk managers, etc.). They will be able to further
            develop their technology knowledge and benefit from the large investment that the firm
            is making to design and build the best-in-class Electronic Trading infrastructure for
            our business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Candidates with C++ experience will focus on server side and with Angular/Java
            experience will focus on front end application rewrites
