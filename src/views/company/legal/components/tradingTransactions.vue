        information on the quote-feed different from that found on the Company servers regarding the
        quote-feed does not provide a sufficient basis for cancellation, termination, or revision of

        Terminal are indicative. The Company does not guarantee that a trade will be made at the
        prices indicated in the graphs on the Trading Terminal at the time of the provision of the
