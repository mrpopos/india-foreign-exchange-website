    <p>All Clients and potential Clients must carefully read this Risk Disclosure before registering on the ABC platform and starting to trade.</p>

    <p>ABC does not provide financial advice or investment recommendations. Clients make their own trading decisions based on their understanding of the market or advice from independent financial experts.</p>
    <p>2. Key Trading Risks</p>
    <p>ðŸ“Œ Volatility â€“ Market prices can be unstable and unpredictable, directly impacting the Clientâ€™s financial results.</p>
    <p>ðŸ“Œ Market Fluctuations â€“ Prices can change suddenly due to economic events or announcements, even when markets are closed. This may cause significant losses or gains.</p>
    <p>ðŸ“Œ Liquidity Risk â€“ The value of assets may be influenced by factors such as supply-demand changes, government policies, economic events, and market sentiment.</p>
    <p>ðŸ“Œ Rapid Market Changes â€“ Some markets may change drastically in a short period, making it difficult to secure profits or limit losses.</p>
    <p>Clients should fully understand these risks before engaging in ABC trading activities.</p>
