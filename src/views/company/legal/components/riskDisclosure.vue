        completing registration on the Website or on the trading terminal and before they start
        making trades. The purpose of this Risk Disclosure (hereinafter Disclosure) is to disclose
        to the Client information about the risks associated with transactions on financial markets
        in general and with derivative financial instruments in particular and to warn the Client
        about possible financial losses and related risks. The list of risks given in this
        Disclosure is not exhaustive because of the variety of possible situations that arise during
        transactions. This disclosure is for information purposes. It is meant to provide a general
        explanation of the risks associated with derivative financial instruments.</span

        >The Company does not provide a Client with any recommendations or advice regarding
        derivative financial instruments and does not give investment recommendations of any kind.
        The Client himself/ herself makes the decision on a trading strategy and on specific actions
        based either on his/her understanding of the market or on consultations with independent
        financial advisers not affiliated with the Company. Products provided on the platform are
        derivative financial instruments, the price of which is derived from the prices of the
        underlying assets/ markets to which they are linked (e.g., currency, stock indices, stocks,
        metals, futures, etc.). For this reason, it is extremely important that the client
        understand the risks associated with trading in the appropriate underlying asset/market.
        Some of these risks are:</span

        <ul>

            <span
              >Volatility – movements in the underlying asset/market price can be unstable and
              unpredictable. This fact has a direct impact on the Client's financial results.
              Understanding market volatility allows the Client to analyze potential profits and
              work out a trading strategy.</span

          </li>
          <li>
            <span
              >Market fluctuations – a sudden change in the price of the underlying asset from one
              level to another. Various factors may cause abrupt changes (e.g., economic events or
              market announcements). These factors may occur both when the market is open or when it
              is closed. When these factors exist at the market close, the price for the underlying
              asset affected by that factor at the market opening may considerably differ from the
              price for the underlying asset at the market close. It may be impossible to close an
              open position at a beneficial price. This may result both in considerable losses and
              in considerable profit.</span
